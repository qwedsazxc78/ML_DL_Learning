# 101 Day for Machine Learning / Deep Learning / Data Science / Self-Car Developer

Hi, Start to become a data scientist and self-car developer, below are my Learning List.

- **Good resource and course** : are very important and efficient for your learning in these knowledage such as Udacity.
- **Programming skill** : R and Python are common language in these area. I recommend to learn python at first. R is great, but this tool
 focus on statistic data analysis and you statistic background.
- **Look experts' data analysis** : Loot [kaggle web] (https://www.kaggle.com/) , it's a nice database for observing how to cook real-world problem step by step, and deeply understand how to analysis real application. For example, titanic survival prediction in kaggle, and you should look this data analysis ["pytanic"](https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails/pytanic). That is a great example for ones that look for

## Recommend Path for Data Scientist
All course are from Udacity, of course, you can select the similar course and concept from Udemy, Cousra ... MOCC course, that's ok.

----
- **Monster** : Become top 10 kernel in [kaggle web] (https://www.kaggle.com/), some interesting topics you should take a look. Even, you can award a prize and speed up your data analysis skill in some competition. 
 1. [**Titanic**]
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) : Machine Learning from Disaster
Start here! Predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics
 2. [**Dogs vs. Cats Redux**]
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition) : You'll write an algorithm to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat.  This is easy for humans, dogs, and cats. Your computer will find it a bit more difficult.

## Start to be a Data Scientist
From my college and SW work, I have the major ideas for all beginner course, so I start from Intermediate course.
